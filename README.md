AI Agent-Driven Selenium Automation Framework
**Description:**

An AI-powered Selenium automation framework enhanced with intelligent agents to optimize web testing. The AI agents dynamically interact with Selenium WebDriver to enable self-healing locators, intelligent failure analysis, predictive test execution, and automated maintenance of test cases.

**Key Features:**

Self-Healing Locators Agent:

        Uses machine learning or fuzzy logic (DOM similarity, XPath heuristics) to identify broken or changed locators at runtime.
        
        Automatically recovers test execution without manual intervention.
        
        Failure Classification Agent:
        
        Analyzes test failures using NLP and historical patterns.
        
        Categorizes issues into types (UI changes, network errors, sync issues).
        
        Suggests probable root cause and resolution path.

Smart Wait Agent:

        Dynamically adjusts wait conditions based on page behavior and AI-learned timings.
        
        Reduces flakiness due to hardcoded sleep/wait.

Test Optimization Agent:

        Prioritizes test cases based on recent code changes (e.g., using Git diffs + historical test coverage).
        
        Skips redundant tests and focuses on impacted modules.

Reporting & Analytics Agent:

        Generates enriched failure logs, visual dashboards, and actionable insights.
        
        Correlates bugs across builds to identify flaky or recurring test cases.

Tech Stack:

Languages: Python / Java

Libraries: Selenium, Scikit-learn / TensorFlow, BeautifulSoup / LXML

CI/CD: Jenkins / GitHub Actions

Reporting: Allure / HTML Reports

Version Control: Git

          AI Models: DOM structure similarity, Decision Trees, Zero-shot classifiers (for bug classification)

Use Case Example:

During regression testing, a UI locator changed due to a redesign. Instead of failing, the Self-Healing Agent matched it to the new DOM structure using AI logic and continued the test. Meanwhile, the Failure Classifier logged it as a UI drift, helping the QA team proactively update the locator.
